# Ballistic

Ballistic is a tool for maintaining a data service using Alpha Vantage for loading stock data for easy storage and real-time access. It uses Redis and MongoDB for real-time cache and backup storage. An user can subscribe to a stock symbol at intraday (per-minute) time scale. Ballistic provides a Python API for developers to subscribe to real-time stock data while buliding up a historical stock dataset.
